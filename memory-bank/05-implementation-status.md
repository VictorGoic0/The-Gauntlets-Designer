## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. Many unit and integration tests not yet implemented
2. Offline mode and connection status not implemented
3. Some cursor tests failing

### Medium Priority

1. No loading state for initial canvas load
2. No connection status indicator
3. No error handling for failed Firestore operations
4. No rate limiting or abuse prevention

### Low Priority

1. No keyboard shortcuts (Delete key works, others not implemented)
2. No undo/redo
3. No object locking or concurrent edit indicators
4. No performance monitoring/analytics

## Performance Status

### Current Measurements

- ✅ 30+ FPS during pan/zoom
- ✅ <50ms perceived cursor latency (via interpolation)
- ✅ <100ms object sync latency
- ✅ Supports 200+ rectangles without issues (tested locally)
- ✅ Supports 3+ concurrent users (tested locally)

### Not Yet Tested
