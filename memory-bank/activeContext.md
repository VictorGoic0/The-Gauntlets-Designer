# Active Context: CollabCanvas

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in **Phase 3** with MVP features largely complete. The focus is on finalizing the MVP requirements and preparing for the 24-hour checkpoint.

## Recent Changes

Based on the current codebase analysis:

### Completed Features ✅

- **Authentication**: Google Sign-In with proper user management
- **Canvas Infrastructure**: 5000x5000 canvas with pan/zoom controls
- **Real-time Cursors**: Multi-user cursor tracking with <50ms perceived latency
- **Presence System**: Online user tracking with onDisconnect cleanup
- **Shape Creation**: Rectangle creation with real-time sync
- **Drag & Move**: Optimistic updates with conflict resolution
- **Selection System**: Object selection and multi-select support
- **Delete Functionality**: Backspace key deletion with optimistic updates
- **State Persistence**: Canvas state persists across sessions
- **Deployment**: Netlify configuration with environment variables

### Current Implementation Status

- **Canvas.jsx**: Fully implemented with all core features
- **CanvasContext.jsx**: Complete state management for canvas operations
- **Firebase Integration**: Complete with Firestore and Realtime Database
- **Hook System**: All custom hooks implemented and working
- **Utility Functions**: Firestore operations and object management complete

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Final Testing**: Comprehensive multi-browser testing
2. **Performance Validation**: Verify 30+ FPS with multiple users
3. **Bug Fixes**: Address any remaining issues
4. **Documentation**: Update README with deployment instructions

### Post-MVP Features (Phase 4+)

1. **Additional Shapes**: Circle and Text components
2. **Transformations**: Resize handles and rotation
3. **Layer Management**: Z-index ordering and layer controls
4. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimizations for scale

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Single Shared Canvas**: Hardcoded project ID 'shared-canvas' for MVP simplicity
- **Last-Write-Wins**: Conflict resolution strategy with deletion priority
- **Optimistic Updates**: Local changes appear instantly for responsive UX
- **Throttled Cursors**: 45ms updates for performance with interpolation
- **onDisconnect Cleanup**: Automatic presence removal on browser close

### Current Architecture Decisions

- **Firestore for Objects**: Primary storage for canvas objects with real-time sync
- **Realtime Database for Presence**: Better suited for presence tracking with onDisconnect
- **Konva.js for Rendering**: High-performance 2D canvas library
- **React Context for State**: Centralized state management for canvas operations

### Performance Considerations

- **Cursor Throttling**: 45ms updates prevent excessive Firestore writes
- **Optimistic Updates**: Local state prevents UI lag during network operations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Konva's built-in optimizations for smooth performance
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server timestamps ensure consistent state across users

## Current Challenges

### Resolved Challenges

- ✅ Real-time synchronization complexity
- ✅ Conflict resolution during simultaneous edits
- ✅ Performance optimization for multiple users
- ✅ State persistence across sessions
- ✅ Firebase configuration and deployment

### Ongoing Considerations

- **Scalability**: How the system performs with more users and objects
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues
- **User Experience**: Smooth interactions and clear feedback
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive testing across different scenarios

## Development Environment

- **Current Branch**: victor.PR-8 (based on git status)
- **Memory Bank**: Recently deleted and being recreated
- **Deployment**: Netlify configuration complete
- **Testing**: Vitest setup with comprehensive test coverage
