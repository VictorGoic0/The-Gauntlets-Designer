# Project Overview

## Project Name

**CollabCanvas** - Real-time Collaborative Canvas Application (Figma Clone)

## Description

A real-time collaborative design tool inspired by Figma, enabling multiple users to design together on a shared canvas with live cursor tracking and instant synchronization. Built as part of "The Gauntlet" Week 1 challenge.

## Project Timeline

- **Type**: 7-day sprint
- **Hard MVP Checkpoint**: 24 hours
- **Current Branch**: `victor.PR-8` (State Persistence & Reconnection)

## Core Value Proposition

Focus on building rock-solid multiplayer infrastructure with basic shape manipulation rather than feature richness. A simple canvas with perfect sync beats a feature-rich canvas with broken collaboration.

## Key Features

### âœ… Completed (MVP Requirements Met)

- Google Sign-In authentication only
- 5,000 x 5,000 pixel canvas with pan and zoom
- Real-time cursor tracking with <50ms perceived latency
- Cursor color assignment from 10-color palette
- Rectangle shape creation and manipulation
- Drag and move objects with real-time sync
- Live presence system showing online users
- State persistence across page reloads
- Deployed to Netlify

### ðŸš§ In Progress

- PR #8: State Persistence & Reconnection improvements
- Offline mode and queued updates
- Connection status indicator

### ðŸ“‹ Planned

- Additional shapes (circles, text)
- Resize and rotate transformations
- Layer management
- Multi-select functionality

## Success Metrics

- Two users can see each other's cursors moving in real-time
- Creating/moving a shape appears instantly for both users
- Canvas state persists if users disconnect and reconnect
- No crashes or broken sync during basic usage
- 30 FPS minimum during all interactions
- <50ms perceived cursor latency (100ms throttle with interpolation)
- <100ms object sync latency
- Support 200+ objects without FPS drops
- Support 3+ concurrent users without degradation
