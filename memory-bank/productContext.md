# Product Context: CollabCanvas

## Why This Project Exists

CollabCanvas addresses the need for real-time collaborative design tools that enable multiple users to work together seamlessly on visual projects. Unlike traditional design tools that require file sharing and manual synchronization, CollabCanvas provides instant, live collaboration.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Collaboration Friction**: Traditional design tools require users to share files, wait for updates, and manually merge changes
2. **Real-time Awareness**: Users need to see what others are working on in real-time to avoid conflicts and enable true collaboration
3. **State Synchronization**: Multiple users editing the same canvas need consistent, conflict-free state management
4. **Performance at Scale**: Collaborative tools must maintain smooth performance with multiple users and many objects

## How It Should Work

- **Instant Sync**: Changes appear immediately for all users without delays or conflicts
- **Visual Awareness**: Users see each other's cursors, presence, and real-time edits
- **Conflict-Free**: Last-write-wins resolution with optimistic deletion ensures data consistency
- **Persistent State**: Work is automatically saved and persists across sessions
- **Smooth Performance**: Maintains 30+ FPS even with multiple users and hundreds of objects

## User Experience Goals

- **Seamless Collaboration**: Users should feel like they're working on the same physical canvas
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of who's online, what they're doing, and where they're working
- **Intuitive Controls**: Pan, zoom, create, select, and manipulate objects with familiar interactions
- **Reliable Sync**: Users should never lose work or experience broken synchronization
- **Performance**: Smooth, responsive interactions even with complex canvases

## Target Users

- **Design Teams**: Multiple designers working on the same project simultaneously
- **Remote Collaborators**: Teams distributed across different locations
- **Real-time Brainstorming**: Quick ideation sessions with multiple participants
- **Design Reviews**: Collaborative review and iteration on visual designs

## Success Metrics

- **Latency**: <50ms perceived cursor latency, <100ms object sync latency
- **Performance**: 30+ FPS with 200+ objects and 3+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: No data loss, no sync conflicts, no crashes during normal usage
- **User Adoption**: Users can immediately understand and use the collaborative features
